          Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to
          making science accessible to all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.

          <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
            lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.

          <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to life through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
            different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
            explore. As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools
            to create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
            give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
            learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will
            excite and inspire them.
